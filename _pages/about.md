I am a Ph.D candidate student in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University as member of Archiecture and Code Optimization Lab (ARC) under the guidance of Prof. Jae W. Lee. I received my B.S.E degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University.

My current research area includes system optimization for graph applications with high-dimensional vector. Specifically, I analyze performance bottlenecks of such workload in CPU microarchitecture and develop software and hardware techniques to mitigate them.

My research has been accepted at top-tier CS conferecnces, including the WebConference (WWW). I have also led multiple ASIC prototyping projects, such as Accelerator for Attention Mechanism and Self-attention Accelerator.
